A very basic website containing a few links to cooking recipes

Skills demonstrated:
Created an index.html which has links to various recipe html files
Each recipe page has a name, image, description and uses ordered and unordered lists for ingredients and steps.
Learned the git cycle of staging, committing and pushing periodically throughout the project.
Hosted the site on github
