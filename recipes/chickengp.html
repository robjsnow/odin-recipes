 <p><h5>Soft and juicy chicken breast baked with rich garlic flavor!  Olive oil is known to have amazing health benefits, and you can't beat the price of chicken in most locations.  If you wish to make it low carb or keto, you can leave out the bread crumbs.</h5></p>
 <h4>Ingredients</h4>
 <ul>
 <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves </li>
 <li>salt to taste</li>
 <li>¾ cup bread crumbs </li>
 <li>½ cup Parmesan cheese  </li>
 <li>1 teaspoon dried basil </li>
 <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
 <li>2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
 <li>1 tablespoon crushed garlic </li>
</ul>
 <h4>Steps</h4>
 <ol>
 <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
 <li>Season chicken breasts with a little salt.</li>
 <li>Mix bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, basil, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
 <li>Heat olive oil and garlic in a skillet over medium heat until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
 <li>Dip chicken breasts in the garlic oil, then into the bread crumb-Parmesan mixture. Place chicken in a baking dish.</li>
 <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
